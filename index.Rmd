description: "This project contains solutions to exercises and homework for the second edition of Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course Using R and Stan. Solutions are offered using the tidyverse and brms packages. Thus, this project should be viewed as a companion to both the original book and Solomon Kurz's translation of the text to tidyverse and brms syntax. Here, we extend the translation to also include solutions to the exercises and homework assignments associated with the course."

# Welcome {-}

This project is a companion to Richard McElreath's *Statistical Rethinking* [@sr2]. For each of the 10 weeks, of the course (materials provided [here](https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019)), I work through the exercises in each chapter covered that week and the associated homework. Like [Solomon Kurz](https://twitter.com/SolomonKurz), I take a {[tidyverse](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/)} [@R-tidyverse; @tidyverse2019] and {[brms](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/)} [@R-brms; @brms2017; @brms2018] approach to solving these problems. For a translation of the actual book text to {tidyverse} and {brms} style code, please check out their project, [*Statistical rethinking* with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse: Second edition](https://bookdown.org/connect/#/apps/4857/access).

You can purchase *Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course in R and Stan* [@sr2] from [CRC Press](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919?utm_source=crcpress.com&utm_medium=referral).
